        <h3>About Mask</h3>
        <p>In China, people have been educated that wearing a mask is a way to prevent or decrease the
          chance of getting infected since the SARS outbreak in Beijing back in 2003. What’s more, after living through SARS and the pollution PM2.5, protecting one’s health with a mask has become a habit.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, different interpretations toward the mask across countries cause misunderstanding. Here is an excerpt from WHO official website relateds to the coronavirus issue:
        </p>


        <div class="paraContainer">
          <h4>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</h4>
          <p class = "citation">"Wearing a medical mask can help limit the spread of some respiratory disease. However, using a mask alone is not guaranteed to stop infections and should be combined with other prevention measures including hand and respiratory hygiene and avoiding close contact – at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people.
"</p>
<p class = "citation">WHO advises on rational use of medical masks thus avoiding unnecessary wastage of precious resources and potential misuse of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). This means using masks only if you have respiratory symptoms."</p>
<p class = "sig"><a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">------World Health Organization</a></p>
        </div>
        <p>
          As a result, wearing a mask implies that someone is already sick, while for a Chinese, it's nothing more than a self-protective measure.
          Anyway, wearing a mask does no harm to others, on the contrary, it protects us especially that the coronavirus has an incubation period of 1-14 days, so even a person without any symptoms can also be a virus carrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope people could defy this stereotype in terms of wearing masks.
          I hope next time you see a Chinese tourist in a metro wearing a mask, there’s no need to be scared.
